The readings for this course include articles, book chapters, and case studies of established companies from around the world. There is no required textbook; however, two books are very relevant to this subject and recommended:

Bartlett, Christopher A., and Sumantra Ghoshal. _Managing Across Borders: The Transnational Solution_. Harvard Business Review Press, 2002. ISBN: 9781578517077. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=KYjHMVuNOAwC&printsec=frontcover)\]

The material indicated as cases are to be treated as pre-readings that should be read in preparation for each class session. Students will benefit more from the material indicated as post-readings if the texts are studied after the sessions, together with the class slides and notes.
