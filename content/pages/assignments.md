Students will have the option of either composing two short reflection papers (maximum 6 pages double-spaced with 12-point font size, excluding exhibits), or one long reflection paper (maximum 12 pages double-spaced with 12-point font size, excluding exhibits).

Reflection Papers
-----------------

### Short Reflection Paper 1: (Due by Session 7)

This paper should address the following:

1.  Formulate and explain the three main lessons that you learned from the study and discussion of the cases of Nissan, SAP, and Teva (either by case or overall).
2.  Reflect and describe on how each of the three lessons learned, as referenced above, relate directly with your managerial experience and/or your company.

Please separate each lesson learned clearly in the text. You can use and refer to the group postings on the cases as well as the reading material, the slides, and notes for the class sessions so far.

### Short Reflection Paper 2 (Due by Session 12)

This paper should address the following:

1.  Choose the three lessons or takeaways that _you_ have learned in the second half of this course that you consider more important. Briefly explain each of them and also justify why you chose each of them. They can come from the content and case covered in each session or from the "open space" discussions at the beginning of the classes. The learning points you choose can be big or small. What matters is that these were new pieces of knowledge to you.
2.  For each of the three learning points you chose, explain briefly how it would solve or help you solve a problem or exploit an opportunity that you have encountered already in your past experience or that you know you will encounter when you go back to your company. Please provide a short description of the problem or opportunity and situation. If need be, a short description of the company or unit can be an exhibit to the paper.

### Long Reflection Paper (Due by Session 12)

Students may choose to propose their own subject/topic condition to approval by the instructor, or will compose a paper that addresses the following:

1.  Choose six lessons or takeaways that you have learned in this course that _you_ consider more important. Briefly explain each of them and also justify why you chose each of them. At least one takeaway should come from the "open space" discussions at the beginning of the classes. The learning points you choose can be big or small. What matters is that these were new pieces of knowledge to you.
2.  For each of the six learning points you chose, explain briefly how it would solve or help you solve a problem or exploit an opportunity that you have encountered already in your past experience or that you know you will encounter when you go back to your company. Please provide a short description of the problem or opportunity and situation. If need be, a short description of the company or unit can be an exhibit to the paper.

Case Postings
-------------

Every student is required to post a small case report (one or two pages) on each of _four_ of the case studies discussed during the course. Such reports may be posted individually or by groups of students or both. What matters is that in the end each student will have participated in four postings. These postings must be submitted 24 hours before the session in which the case is discussed in class.

The case reports should address one or more of the suggested study questions for each case, should start with an overall comment about the case, namely if the case was surprising or novel and why. Please be concise in the report; an outline format is permitted.
